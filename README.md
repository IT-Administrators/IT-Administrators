## :man_technologist: About me

I'm an IT nerd working currently as an IT-Admin.

On my job i'm specialized in mobile device management, client security, software deployment and automation. But i'm interested in every part of IT. 

In private, im a hobby programmer, building everything i want. From useful scripts for admins in Powershell [PSForAdmins](https://github.com/IT-Administrators/PSForAdmins) or just learning new languages like [Python](https://github.com/IT-Administrators/pycutroh) or [C++](https://github.com/IT-Administrators/cutpproh).
